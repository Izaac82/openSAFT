The purpose\r\nbehind releasing the code is to promote discussion and open exploration of the \r\nSAFT method for concrete non-destructive inspection. \r\n \r\nFiles: \r\n\r\n-main.m - General Starter File To Inspect Example Dataset (JAB4.lbv)\r\n-qgui.m - Example GUI built using MATLAB to Test Different Color Gains\r\n-a_filereader.m - Simple binary file reader configured to read in 66 time domain signals 2048 points in length. \r\n-a_plotBscan.m - SAFT Algorithm to assemble a B-Scan estimate and plot as a image\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Submissions\r\n-This is an open project, the authors welcome suggestions, new code, and posting of problem datasets. \r\n-Q.C. is missing from this processing method completely. Please feel free to submit code for Q.C. Algorithms. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Disclaimer \r\nThis code was written based upon existing literature, and some creative problem solving to speed up the process. \r\nThe enclosed code is for research and education purposes.
