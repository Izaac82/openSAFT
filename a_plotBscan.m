function [ curscan ] = a_plotBscan(Z, curscan )
%a_plotBscan This function generates a B-Scan estimate based on a sensor
%matrix signals Z and curscan struct of values. 
%   a_plotBscan constructs the x-y matrix by performing a rough numerical
%   intergration over all of the A-Scan signals. Ultimately a scaled image
%   is plotted. No actual integration is performed and the sampling rate is
%   assume to be significantly small enough to make summation a reasonable
%   approximation. (this was not checked it just made things much faster
%   and did not look significantly different).
